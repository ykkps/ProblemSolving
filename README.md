# LeetCode Study Group ðŸ§ 

Welcome to our collaborative LeetCode study repository\! This space is for us to practice problem-solving, learn from each other's code, and track our progress.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository:**

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProblemSolving.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ProblemSolving
    ```
3.  **Create your branch for the current problem:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b week_number_problem-number
    ```
    (e.g., `git checkout -b week_01_yc_912_sort_an_array`)
4.  **Add your solution file(s) in the appropriate week's folder** (e.g., `week_01/yc_912_sort_an_array.java`).
5.  **Commit and push your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Adds [Your Name]'s solution for [Problem Name]"
    git push -set-upstream origin branch_name
    ```
    (e.g., `git push --set-upstream origin week_01_yc_912_sort_an_array`)
6.  **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub for the team to review
